    "### 2.1 Instantiation\n",
    "A route planner can be easily constructed by passing the **scenario** and the **planning problem** to `RoutePlanner` object. As for the backend, there are currently three supported options:\n",
    "1. NETWORKX: uses built-in functions from the networkx package, tends to change lane later\n",
    "2. NETWORKX_REVERSED: uses built-in functions from the networkx package, tends to change lane earlier\n",
    "3. PRIORITY_QUEUE: uses A-star search to find routes, lane change maneuver depends on the heuristic cost\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Planning all possible routes\n",
    "The route planner plans a route for all possible combinations of start / goal lanelets. E.g. if our initial state is located in two lanes (due to overlapping of lanelets), and the same for our goal state, the route planner will try to plan routes for the four possible combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Retrieving a route\n",
    "Planned routes can be retrieved by using simple indices, or based on some heuristic functions to determine the best route of all. A route consists of a list of lanelet ids that leads from the initial state to the goal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Retrieving reference path\n",
    "A reference path is automatically generated for each planned routes. The center lines of lanelets of a route is used to construct the reference path. The resulting polyline is then smoothened with Chaikin's corner cutting algorithm."
